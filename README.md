# Quranic Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze and visualize various aspects of the Holy Quran using Python and popular data analysis libraries. Through this project, 
we explore the text of the Quran, study its structure, analyze the frequency of important terms, visualize the distribution of verses across chapters, and much more.

## Features

- **Chapter and Verse Distribution:** Visualize the distribution of verses across chapters (Surahs) in the Quran.
- **Word Clouds:** Generate word clouds to explore the most frequent words in specific chapters or the entire Quran.
- **Prophet Names Frequency:** Analyze the frequency of prophet names mentioned in the Quran.
- **Important and Condemned Terms:** Study the frequency of important and condemned terms mentioned in the Quran.
- **Geographical Locations:** Explore the occurrences of geographical locations mentioned in the Quran.
